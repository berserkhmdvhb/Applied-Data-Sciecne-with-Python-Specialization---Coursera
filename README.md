# Applied Data Sciecne with Python Specialization - Coursera
This repository servers as an archive for remembering the tricks and solutions I am learning during the **"Applied Data Science with Python"** Specialization from university of Michigan by Coursera.
The solutions and implementations of each course will be added to this repository.
## I strongly recommend to think on and implement the assignments by yourself and then check the solutions. Please respect the [Coursera Honor Code](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818863)
